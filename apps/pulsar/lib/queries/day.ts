 * One statement, one subquery per thing the day reads: everything the day's derivation needs,

 * written here, the same choice `lib/evidence/reading-lookups.ts` took, so
 * the policy is the reason the rows are safe, not a second copy of it.
 *
 * `retired_at` is `timestamptz`: read as `::date` bare it renders in the
 * session's own zone (UTC here), so a commitment retired after 19:00 Bogotá
 * would still ask for one more day. `at time zone ${TIME_ZONE}` first turns
 * it into the person's own civil day before the cast, the same move
 * `lib/queries/goal.ts`'s `goalSpan` already makes on `created_at`.
 *
 * `facts` reads from the earlier of the week's Monday and the month's first:
 * `times_per_month` asks by its month and counts what the week alone never
 * reads. What is week-bound (the goal's measure) narrows back in TS.
 *
 * `goals` is the list RP-24 filters: an archived goal is never in it, and
 * `DayScreen` only ever groups a row under a goal it finds here. `commitments`
 * and `one_offs` do not join to the goal, so a row of an archived goal still
 * rides along, but nothing loops over either outside the per-goal grouping and
 * it never draws. `month_budgets`, `goal_tasks` and `scheduled_count` join
 * only open goals (`openGoal`). `goals.length === 0` is also what decides the
 * day's own empty state (`empty-day.tsx`), so an all-archived person needs no
 * second check.

/**
 * Feeds the day screen in exactly two transactions, fanned with `Promise
 * .all` and never chained (RNP-03): `withGoalsDb`'s one statement is
 * everything the day derives from, `withReadingDb`'s is every known
 * source's rows for `[day, day]`. The evidence promise is settled here, not
 * awaited bare — a rejection degrades to `"unreadable"` and the declared
 * facts alone decide the day (RNP-04): never a blank day, never an error
 * page.
 *
 * `goals`, `oneOffs` and `commitments` ride out of the same `withGoalsDb`
 * statement `view` is derived from — no third query, still four statements
 * total (`withGoalsDb`'s settle + select, `withReadingDb`'s settle + select).
 * `DayScreen` is what groups a slot under its goal and draws a
 * one-off beneath the last one; `DayView` and `deriveDay` are
 * unchanged.
 *
 * `oneOffs` carries every one-off dated on or before `day` that no fact yet
 * names, whatever day that fact was written on (RP-19):
 * an undone one-off from three days back rides every `loadDay` after its
 * own until it is done or deleted, read here through `o.day <= day` beside
 * the row-level `not exists` the SQL above already runs. `OneOffSummary`
 * still carries its own `day`, unclamped, so a caller can tell a carried one
 * from today's own by comparing it against the day drawn.
