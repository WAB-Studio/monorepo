// returns. Kept narrow on purpose: anything the DNS lookup itself cannot
// answer cleanly (timeout, SERVFAIL, no network) has to read as
// deliverable, never as a reason to lock a reader out of their own account.
//
// Not a "use server" file, on purpose (RNP-09): `app/actions/account.ts`
// exported this alongside `sendSignInLink`, which made it a public server
// action reachable from any client, and no suite called it. Living here it
// is a plain function a check can import and call with fake resolvers.
