// Proves RNP-03 and RNP-04 against the seeded person of module 20, the way
// `scripts/harness/seed-goal.ts` reaches a server action: by stubbing the
// three modules that only exist inside Next (`server-only`, `next/headers`,
// `next/cache`) before the first `@/`-rooted import, and by redeeming the
// same `private/session-<lane>.json` cookie `mint-session.ts` left standing.
// Nothing here fabricates a claim — `getPerson()` sees exactly the identity
// that cookie names.
//
// The statement count comes from the driver, not from reading `day.ts`:
// `postgres`'s own `debug` option fires once for every statement it puts on
// the wire, `begin` and `commit` included (`apps/orbit/scripts/harness/
// instrument.ts`'s own technique). Module 8's done criterion names "four
// statements... two settles and two queries", so `begin`/`commit` are
// counted off the wire and then excluded before the assertion — they are a
// round trip each, but never a statement `day.ts` chose to send. Excluding
// them is bounded, not blind: each connection must bracket exactly one
// `begin` and one `commit`, never a `rollback` and never a second one of
// either — an extra transaction-control statement is itself a round trip
// `day.ts` did not choose to spend, and independent validation found this
// file originally let it hide inside the very count it was supposed to
// bound. Every run asserts the bracket, cold included, and the overlap is
// decided by call order (`./plan/wire.ts`), never by timestamps.
// The type-fetch `postgres` sends on a connection's first-ever use is netted
// out the same bounded way, by an exact match on its own text (never a bare
// substring, which let a statement merely mentioning `pg_catalog.pg_type`
// net itself out too) and capped at one per connection, zero on every warm
// run. Five consecutive warm calls are asserted, not one or two: a fix that
// only holds for the first couple is a fix a later screen the same minute
// would still be paying for.
//
// The degraded scenario needs a fresh module graph: `lib/evidence/
// registry.ts` builds its reader map once, at import time, and a process
// that already ran the real reader cannot un-import it. This file re-execs
// itself as a child with `--degraded-child`, the one place `./reading-
// lookups` is stubbed to reject, and reads the child's one line of JSON back.

/**
 * Proves RP-19 widened 2026-09-28: `loadDay(today).oneOffs` carries a
 * one-off dated three days back, still undone, with its own `day`; drops one
 * dated three days back whose fact was written on a day other than today —
 * "done leaves the list for good", true on any day the fact was written, not
 * only today's; and never carries one dated tomorrow. Built through
 * `createOneOff` (`app/actions/one-offs.ts`) for every row, plus one raw
 * insert for the "got a fact yesterday" case: `declareFact` itself refuses a
 * caller-supplied day for a one-off (`requireDayForSubject`'s own
 * `dayOnOneOff`, RP-06 never redates one), so a fact dated anywhere but
 * today can only be seeded the way `runZoneCheck` above already seeds state
 * `declareFact` cannot reach. The `loadDay(today)` call itself is wrapped in
 * `reportRun` the same way the cold/warm calls in `runMain` are, so the
 * carrying oneOffs list and the four-statement count are proven from the
 * very same call. Cleaned up by the ids this function returns: the fact
 * first (`facts_delete_self`), then every one-off (`one_offs_delete_self`,
 * which refuses a row that still carries a fact).
