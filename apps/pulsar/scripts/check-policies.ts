/**
 * Drives every policy and grant on `goals` against the real database — and the
 * guard-and-settle body `lib/session.ts`'s `withGoalsDb` runs before every
 * query — instead of reading either from a migration (AGENTS.md,
 * "Verification").
 *
 * Three parts, in the shape of `apps/voyager/scripts/check-sync.ts`:
 *
 * Part 1 drives RLS and grants. Two `randomUUID()` subjects, their
 * `auth.users` rows inserted inside one transaction that always throws at the
 * end to force a ROLLBACK, so nothing survives it and `harness:census` does
 * not move — `@repo/harness-registry` is never needed. Every risky attempt
 * runs inside its own savepoint, so one `42501` never aborts the ones after
 * it. `anon` is driven too and refused everything.
 *
 * Part 2 calls `withSettledTransaction` (`@/lib/settled-transaction`)
 * directly — the exact function `withGoalsDb` calls, not a copy of it — so a
 * mutation *inside that function* turns this script red, from either call
 * site. This alone does **not** prove `lib/session.ts` still calls it, or
 * calls it correctly: a rewrite of `withSettledDb` that skips
 * `withSettledTransaction` entirely, or hands it an adapter that never
 * executes the statement it is given, is invisible to Part 2 — neither
 * mutation touches the function Part 2 imports. `P27` also reads a *second*,
 * later connection on the same pool to check nothing leaked past the first
 * one's commit; that comparison is only meaningful when both queries land on
 * the same physical backend — measured (`docs/TRAPS.md`, "claims (and role)
 * can survive a connection through the pooler") to land on a *different* one
 * often enough, under Supavisor's transaction pooling, to both flag correct
 * code and miss a real regression. `P27` reads `pg_backend_pid()` from both
 * queries, retries the bare one once on a mismatch, and reports
 * `INCONCLUSIVE` — never `PASS` — if the two still disagree: an unmeasured
 * comparison must never look like a clean one. `P26`, which checks the settle
 * from inside its own single transaction on its own connection, needs none of
 * this.
 *
 * Part 3 closes the Part-2 gap: it imports `withGoalsDb`/`withReadingDb`
 * themselves from `lib/session.ts` and drives them for real, so a rewrite
 * that skips `withSettledTransaction` — invisible to Part 2 — turns this red
 * too (and, as it happens, also breaks the no-session guard, which is what
 * `P34` below catches). `verifiedClaims` is the one thing genuinely out of
 * reach here — it needs `next/headers`'s `cookies()`, which throws outside a
 * request (the same wall module 3's own validator hit for orbit) — so
 * `@repo/supabase-auth` is mocked with `node:test`'s `mock.module`
 * (`--experimental-test-module-mocks`, the same flag `check:unit` already
 * runs under) to hand back a canned session without ever calling
 * `createSupabaseServerClient`. `server-only`, which `lib/session.ts` and
 * `@/db/client` both import at their top, is not mockable that way —
 * `mock.module` still resolves the real specifier first — so `NODE_PATH`
 * points this script alone at `scripts/node-stubs/server-only`, a local
 * no-op stand-in `next dev`/`next build` never sees (they never read
 * `NODE_PATH`, and nothing under `scripts/` is on their module path). What
 * runs after that is `lib/session.ts` itself, unmodified, importing the real
 * `@/db/client` and calling the real `withSettledTransaction`.
