// Proves module 28's `loadGoal` fan-out the same way `scripts/check-day.ts`
// proves `loadDay`'s: by counting statements off the driver's own wire, not
// off `goal.ts`'s source text, and by redeeming this lane's own
// `private/session-<lane>.json` cookie rather than typing anything into
// `/entrar`. Read that file first — the technique below (debug-hook
// instrumentation, one begin/one commit per connection, an exact match on
// `postgres`'s own type-fetch text, capped at one per connection and zero
// warm) is copied from it verbatim, not reinvented.
//
// This closes the holes module 28's own validator and this module's own
// first round each found. First (module 28's gitignored probe, a copy sits
// at `private/reportes/check-goal.modulo28.ts`): its SQL-text assertion only
// tested that `"goals"."goals"` appears *somewhere* in the reading
// statement, so a `from` bound rewritten as a hardcoded
// `sql`'0001-01-01'::date`` still passed — the `to` bound's own reference
// carried the whole assertion. `assertReadingBounds` below extracts the
// `between <from> and <to>` clause `goalSpan`'s own two subqueries land in
// (`lib/queries/goal.ts`) and checks each side on its own. Second: that same
// text-only check also passes a bound that names `"goals"."goals"` but reads
// the wrong row or the wrong column — both bounds on `horizon`, say. Text
// alone cannot tell; `assertBoundsResolveToGoalRow` below replays the exact
// `from`/`to` fragments the wire carried, values included, and compares what
// they resolve to against the goal's own `created_at` and `horizon`, fetched
// independently.
//
// The fixture also used to retire its only quantity commitment, forcing
// `declaredTotal` to zero on purpose — the same value a mutation that zeroes
// `declaredTotal` whenever evidence is unreadable also produces, so the
// degraded child's own assertion could never tell the two apart. It now
// keeps that commitment active with one real declared fact instead
// (`seedMixedMeasureGoal`), so the degraded child's declared-total assertion
// has a nonzero number a bug can actually miss.
//
// This script seeds its own goal every run — through `createGoal`,
// `addCommitment` and `declareFact`, never a raw INSERT — the same doors a
// person's own screen uses.
