// The one door: every screen imports its primitives, and the Radix Themes
// components it composes them with, from here and nowhere else.
//
// The door exports nothing the design has not dressed. What is missing, and why:
// no `Card` and no `Box` — a group is ruled with a hairline, never a card and
// never a border box; no `Callout` and no `Badge` — this design has no colour
// for failure and no badge anywhere; no `SegmentedControl` — a cadence is
// chosen with chips; no Radix `Table` — the review's is `./table`, dressed
// from its two boards, and an undressed export is the one a screen in a hurry
// uses undressed; no `Heading` — `Text` already carries the whole type scale
// and a second way to set a heading is a second scale, at a size (24px) the
// token table does not hold; no `Skeleton` — Radix paints its own from its own theme, and the
// dressed one below draws the line colour instead; no `Spinner` — no board in
// this app draws one, the loading state is the skeleton.
//
// These three stay because they decide no colour and no size: `Flex` and `Grid`
// place what a screen gives them and paint nothing, and `VisuallyHidden` moves
// a name out of sight for a reader that is not looking.
