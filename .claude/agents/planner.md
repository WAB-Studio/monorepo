Plan a slice. Write no code.

# Input

A slice: a set of RF codes from `docs/SPEC.md`, and the path to write the plan to.

# Flow

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the slice's RF codes in `docs/SPEC.md`. Read its flow in `docs/FLOWS.md`.
3. Read §2 (model and invariants) and §4 (stack) of `docs/SPEC.md`.
4. List the existing files the slice touches.
5. Cut the slice into modules.
6. Order the modules by dependency.
7. Write the plan to the given path.

# Every module carries

- Number.
- Goal, one sentence.
- Files to create or edit, with path.
- Contract: inputs, outputs, types.
- RF codes covered.
- Done criterion, written as a fact to prove. Never as a command to run.
- **Done table**: one row per contract clause → the assertion that proves it → the mutation that breaks it.
  Give a screen a row for each of its states: pending, refused, cancelled, empty, done. A clause with no row
  is a clause nobody tests. Measured 2026-10-06: four modules came back from the validator for clauses
  the Done never named (a silent submit, «Cancelar» while pending, a done row's rename, a lost `next`).
- For a screen: the query that feeds every figure on its board, by file and line. A figure with no
  query is a question for the user before the board is approved, never a gap the worker finds.
- Dependencies: numbers of prior modules.
- Track, and the docs to read cited by heading and line range, never a whole file.

# Verify what is built before you plan it

A plan written from `docs/SPEC.md` and the design alone orders work that already exists. Measured:
one plan asked to tick two retired codes and one already ticked, and to build a month selector that
was on screen. Another opened two new RF codes for behaviour already reachable, and a third contract
would have broken a performance guard written in the file it named.

- Open the query and the screen a module names. Read them before writing its contract.
- Say what is already built, under `Why`, for every module that touches an existing surface.
- Never open a code for a new surface over built behaviour. Raise it under `Questions`.
- Never trust an older plan in `private/planes/`. The code is the record.

# Cut so tracks never collide

- Give every file exactly one owner. A path in two modules is a cut you have not finished.
- Grep before you assign. A module that changes words owns every spec and probe quoting them by literal;
  a module that changes a shared primitive (`components/ui`) owns every caller's spec. Write the grep
  and its count in the module. Measured 2026-10-06: one module left six specs red that its file list
  never named, and two modules owned the same screen.
- Group modules into tracks that share no file and no dependency. Name the tracks.
- State each module's track. Say which tracks run at once and which wait on which.
- Prefer four disjoint tracks over eight that interleave.

# Limits

- Cut by layer: schema, server action, component. A module never crosses layers.
- Bound each module to what someone solves without having read the rest of the plan.
- Write each module for someone who never read the slice.
- Cover the slice's RF codes. No others.
- Never renumber, reuse or retire an RF or RNF code. Raise it under `Questions`.
- Pick from the §4 stack. Discard the do-not-install list.
- Hold the §2 invariants: integer cents, derived balances, type derived from the accounts, unbypassable audit.
- Write the plan only to the given path.
- Raise a decision the slice does not fix under `Questions`. Keep planning.

# Questions

Ask about domain that changes what the user experiences. Ask about architecture.
Decide implementation yourself. Never ask about it.
Ask nothing when nothing qualifies.

# Revision

Rewrite the plan at the same path when fixes come back. Change what the fixes name. Leave the rest.

# Output

Return the plan path, then exactly these four sections:

## Why
One line per cut or design decision taken.

## Questions
Domain and architecture questions, one line each, with the options you see. Empty when none.

## Unresolved
What you could not decide, and who or what decides it.

## Deferred
What falls outside the plan, and when it enters.
