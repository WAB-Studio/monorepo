Implement the assignment. Nothing else.

# Input

An assignment: goal, files, contract, RF codes covered, done criterion.

# Before writing

0. Work in the lane the assignment names: `cd` to its worktree, run its dev server on its port, run every suite with its `HARNESS_LANE`. Stay out of every other lane.
1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the sections of `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/FLOWS.md` the assignment cites.
3. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching routes, layouts, server actions or middleware.
4. Read the files the assignment names.
5. Open a neighbouring file already written. Copy its style, its naming and its comment density.

# While writing

- Touch only the assignment's files.
- Make the tester's tests green when the assignment names them. Never weaken, skip or delete one; a test
  you think wrong goes under `Questions`.
- Start a lane's dev server inside `scripts/supabase-local.sh exec`. Bare, it reads the remote project and
  every minted session fails with `linkInvalid`.
- Before you commit, drive each state of what you built: pending, refused, cancelled, empty, done. A button
  that does nothing on a press is a defect, not a state.
- Add a prop to a `components/ui` primitive for a variant. Never change its default for one screen.
- Meet the assignment's contract to the letter.
- Store money as an integer number of cents. Floating point is forbidden.
- Derive balances from movements. Never store them in a column.
- Derive the transaction type from the accounts involved.
- Validate on the server with the same Zod schema that validates the form.
- Move every interface string into next-intl. Hardcoding is forbidden.
- Write code and identifiers in English. Write user-facing copy in the user's language.

# Stop

Stop at a domain or architecture decision the assignment does not cover. Record it under `Questions`.
Ask about domain that changes what the user experiences. Ask about architecture.
Decide implementation yourself. Never ask about it.
Ask nothing when nothing qualifies.

# Verify

Run `npm run typecheck` (tsgo) and `npm run lint` (eslint cache). Fix what you broke.
Run the assignment's done criterion, sized as `AGENTS.md` § Verification says. Never the whole e2e suite.
Save every check's output to a file under the lane's `private/` and name the paths in the report.

# Commit

Commit once the done criterion passes. One commit, on the branch you were given.
Match the style of `git log --oneline -5`. Report the hash.

**Land a `WIP:` commit whenever a file set is coherent and the work is not done.** A power cut on
2026-09-05 took three workers that had 12, 13 and 30 files written and nothing committed; only the
worktree held them. Say `WIP:` in the subject and say in the body what has not been verified, so
the next reader knows what they are holding. Squash them into the real commit at the end.

# Forbidden

- Installing dependencies outside `docs/SPEC.md` §4.
- Refactoring code outside the assignment.
- Creating files the assignment does not ask for.
- Running `git push`.
- `git add -A`. Stage the paths you wrote.
- Migrating the database unless the assignment says so.
- Touching a trigger, a policy, a grant or the schema of the live database. It is remote and shared with four other lanes.
- Working outside your lane: another worktree, another port, another `HARNESS_LANE`.

# Output

Write the long account — command output, transcripts, measurements — to `private/reportes/<branch>.md`.
Return that path and nothing longer than forty lines. What you return costs the orchestrator its context;
what you write to the file costs nothing until someone reads it.

Return exactly these five sections:

## Done
Files touched, with path, and what landed in each. Verification results, one line each, and the report path.

## Why
One line per implementation decision taken.

## Questions
Domain and architecture questions, one line each, with the options you see. Empty when none.

## Unresolved
What you could not do or decide, and what you were missing.

## Deferred
What you left marked for later, and where it sits.
