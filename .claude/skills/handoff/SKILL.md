# Handoff

The one document that survives a session. `private/handoffs/HANDOFF-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.md`, America/Bogotá.

## Opening — "iniciemos"

1. Read the newest file in `private/handoffs/`.
6. Read `git log --oneline -8`, `git branch -vv`, `git worktree list`, `git status --short`.
3. Check the dev server on :3000. Start it if it is down.
4. Compare what the handoff says against what the repo shows. Say every difference out loud.
5. Take the first item of its `Lo que sigue` and start. Ask nothing the handoff already answers.

## Closing — "cerremos handoff", or on the window's own warning

The `context-watch.sh` hook says when the window passes 400k tokens. Take it as the phrase and close
at once, forced. Decided by the user 2026-10-01: «en el momento que lleguemos a 400k cerrar todo forzado».

1. **Stop every subagent still running** (`TaskStop`). Never wait for one. Its branch holds what it
   committed; say in the file what it was doing and what it had proved.
2. Commit and push every branch that carries work. Leave no tree dirty.
3. Run `git log <base>..HEAD --format='%h %an <%ae>%n%(trailers)'` on each. No Claude attribution.
4. Write the file.
5. Put what outlives the session in the file that owns it, never in memory outside the repo:
   a rule in `AGENTS.md`, a trap in `docs/TRAPS.md`, a tick in `docs/SPEC.md`.
6. Tell the user the path.

## What the file carries

- **§1 Lo primero que hay que saber** — the branches, their tips, what is merged, what is running, what is open.
- **§2..§n** — one section per piece of work, with the numbers that were measured.
- **Lo que sigue** — numbered, in order, first item ready to start.
- **Reglas duras** — what cost blood and will cost it again.
- **Lecciones** — what the next session should do differently.

## How it is written

- Say what was verified and how. Say plainly what was not.
- Give the number, not the adjective. «145/0/9 en 11,6 m», never «la suite pasó bien».
- Name the file and the line. `accounts-screen.tsx:502`, not «la pantalla de cuentas».
- Carry every decision the user took, and mark which ones are closed.
- Carry the questions still waiting on the user, in their own line.
- Write it in the user's language.
